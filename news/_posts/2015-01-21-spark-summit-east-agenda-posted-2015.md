The <a href="http://spark-summit.org/east/2015/agenda">agenda for Spark Summit East</a> is now posted, with 38 talks from organizations including Goldman Sachs, Baidu, Salesforce, Novartis, Cisco and others. This inaugural Spark conference on the US East Coast will run March 18th-19th 2015 in New York City. More details are available on the <a href="http://spark-summit.org/east/2015/agenda">Spark Summit East website</a>, where you can also <a href="http://prevalentdesignevents.com/sparksummit2015/east/registration.aspx">register</a> to attend.

In addition, talk proposals are now open for <a href="http://spark-summit.org/2015">Spark Summit West</a>, to run in San Francisco on June 15-17, 2015. We expect Spark Summit West to be the largest Spark community conference yet, with nearly 2000 attendees, so send in your talks if you have exciting use cases, tutorials, or development talks about Spark. You can submit your talk through the <a href="http://prevalentdesignevents.com/sparksummit2015/speaker/">online submission form</a>. Spark Summit East had 169 submissions, our largest set yet, so we expect West to be equally exciting.
